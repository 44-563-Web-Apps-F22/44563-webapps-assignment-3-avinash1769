    <h3> York Yak</h1>
    <h2 style="color: yellow"> York Yak</h2>

    <ol>
        <li> Yaks are able to withstand temperatures of -40degrees C (â€“40 degrees F). At this temperature, they have even been seen bathing in lakes and rivers.  </li>
        <li> Yaks live at the highest altitude of any mammal.  </li> 
        <li> Yaks have firm, dense horns which they use to break through snow in order to get the plants that are buried underneath.  </li>
        <li> Yaks grunt and, unlike cattle, are not known to produce the characteristic bovine lowing (mooing) sound. </li>
        <li> Most yaks are domesticated although there is also a small, vulnerable wild yak population.</li>
    </ol>
